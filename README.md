# Installation
1. Go to [hacklet.js](hacklet.js)
2. Click on `Copy raw file`
3. Make a new bookmark
4. Paste the code in the `URL` section of the bookmark
5. Give the bookmark a name, such as `Kahoot AI`
6. Click on the bookmark to start the first-time configuration
7. Paste in a [Gemini API key](aistudio.google.com/apikey)

# Usage
1. Go into a Kahoot game with `Show questions & answers` enabled
2. When there's a question on screen, you can use the bookmark to get answers

# Features
- When the question is revealed and the bookmark is used, Gemini is queried
for an answer. This answer is not guarenteed to be one of the actual answers,
but it does allow you to know what the answer could be faster than everyone else.

- When the answers are revealed and the bookmark is used, Gemini works better now,
and once the query finishes, the correct answer gets a white highlight.
